# Incendios

Hey everyone! This is our first repository on GitHub, it was a bit of a challenge to work with shinnyapp, as this was also our first time working with it.
We've decided to plot the evolution of number of fires and burnt area, over the last two decades in several countries of the European Union.

Above you will find 2 csv files containing the data. "n_indendios.csv" has the number os fires data, while "area_ardida.csv" has the data regarding the burnt area in hectares. Have fun exploring it!
